# Bubble Sort on Intel 8085
Small listing of code for project I have done learning Hardware and Software Architecture on topic of programming Intel 8085.
It features Main that creates test vectors and then calls the routine to sort these.
Routine gets value of Accumulator and HL pair as length and address of first element of vector to be sorted respectively.
