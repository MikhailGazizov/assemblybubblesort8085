# Bubble Sort on Intel 8085
Code of Assembly Project which is part of my continuous assessment in subject of Hardware and Software Architecture in NOVA IMS
It features Main that creates test vectors and then calls the routine to sort them.
Routine gets value of Accumulator and HL pair as length and address of first element of vector to be sorted respectively.
